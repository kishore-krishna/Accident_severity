How severe can accident be?

*Imported test and train to .ipynb file and checked for general analysis. 

*The data was perfect and ready to build the model

* Built a model on Logistic regression and had very low validation score

* Hypertuned the parameters in algorithm and used solver like newton-cg, liblinear and got improved validation scores in newton-cg

* Used newton-cg because the prediciton variable has multiple classifications

*Submission file has the prediction variable (Severity) with the Accident ID
